# Johan-Dev-CV 
The goal of this project is to have a functioning site to build upon for the future while I progress on my journey as I get better at coding.
longterm I want it to be easily accessible for recruiters and other people interested in what I do, so a easily available and usable website is important.

## User Experience
The scope I want for user experience is that they a calm as they enter the website, nothing out of the ordinary that makes you wonder how to find anything, it should be really easy to see what you can click and use as you come in for the first time. 

User Goals
First Time Visitor Goals
Returning Visitor Goals
Frequent Visitor Goals

## Testing & Bugs
- Fixed a bug where I forgot to properly link my css style sheet to all my webpages.
- Fixed typo in linking HTML pages to eachother causing 404 errors
- Fixed a bug where I spent 4-5 hours on getting my footer to stick to the bottom, after alot of troubleshooting and shouting I came to the conclusion that I am blind because I forgot to check the position attribute in css, it was set to absolute, setting it to fixed solved all my issues.
- Started Testing Flexbox, spent hours figuring out how it works. I thinkI broke my header and body elements atleast 200 time's.

## Unfixed bugs
- No bugs that I know of.
