# Johan-Dev-CV 
The goal of this project is to have a functioning site to build upon for the future while I progress on my journey as I get better at coding.
longterm I want it to be easily accessible for recruiters and other people interested in what I do, so a easily available and usable website is important.

## Features

I built the website to be easy on the eyes and easily available for anyone on any device. The colors used gives a calm approach to a website instead of colors that are really intense and hard on the eyes.
All elements in my navigation bar are clickable and resizes accordingly, the main landing index give some short info about me and the journey I'm on. The footer that sticks to the bottom of your screen and follows you through out your time on the website.

### Existing Features 

- __Navigation bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Portfolio and Contact Me page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

## Features Left to Implement

- Frames for the portfolio pictures with added information on the projects in the frame
- A take me to home link on the success page


## User Experience
The scope I want for user experience is that they a calm as they enter the website, nothing out of the ordinary that makes you wonder how to find anything, it should be really easy to see what you can click and use as you come in for the first time.
